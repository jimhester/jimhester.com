I have lived in northeast Ohio for over 25 years and have long had an interest
in computers and programming, starting with writing programs in BASIC on our
family's IBM PS/1. I have also long had an interest in biology, particularly
genetics. Combining my two interests led me to pursue Bioinformatics, where I
worked at the Cleveland Clinic.


My [research at CCF](http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2739-7082) focused
on using high-throughput sequencing to study a variety of issues, such as
maternal obesity in mice, microbial populations in the Cuyahoga river, and
Plasmodium Vivax malaria.

Since joining RStudio I have given a number of [talks](TODO) about R and R
packages, which has allowed my to travel to Europe and Australia, as well as
throughout the United States.

While at the Cleveland Clinic, I became an avid user of the statistical
programming language R, using it to process, visualize, model and report our
data. I also began writing R packages and contributing to open source packages
on GitHub. I enjoyed working with open source software and being part of the R
community, so looked for opportunities that allowed me to continue to do so,
which eventually landed me at RStudio. You can follow my current work [on GitHub]
(https://github.com/jimhester).

In my free time, I love spending time with my family, my two daughters and my
dog.
